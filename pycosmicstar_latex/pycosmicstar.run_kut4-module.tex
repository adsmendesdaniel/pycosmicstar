   4th-order Runge-Kutta method for solving the
   initial value problem \{ y\} ’ = \{ F(x,\{ y\} )\} , where
    \{ y\} = \{ y[0],y[1],...y[n-1]\} .
    x,y    = initial conditions.
    xStop = terminal value of x.
    h      = increment of x used in integration.
    F      = user-supplied function that returns the
              array F(x,y) = \{ y’[0],y’[1],...,y’[n-1]\} .
